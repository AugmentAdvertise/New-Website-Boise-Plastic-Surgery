A Note to My Patients:
"The reason I chose to specialize in plastic surgery was because of the satisfaction of seeing individuals achieve their personal goals with this unique kind of surgery. This transformation is not merely physical. I have witnessed profound changes in self confidence leading to more positive decision-making and changes in life style. These changes allow my patients to not just be a passive spectator in their life, but to take a proactive course of action and make life happen."
